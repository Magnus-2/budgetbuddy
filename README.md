# budgetbuddy

BudgetBuddy is a app where you can determine a weekly budget which you want to spend over the week. So you can see everytime you open the app how much do you have spend and how much money do you have left for the rest of the Week. You also see when you are over your budget(your left Money will get red, see more in the Video). Furthermore you see how much you spend on which single day. It is also very easy and intuitive to track the money you spend. Also when you made a mistake in your input like a typo you can simply correct your input.

BudgetBuddy solves a very importend pain point for me because since we are in Thailand its realy hart to get a overview on how much Money i spent over the week. Mainly it is so hart to get a overview because we travel alot on the weekends to see some sights from thailand and alsow i am not used to always eat out (no kitchen) I used to coke for me by myself. Forthermore I usually withdraw Money in large amounts because every withdraw cost alot of fees which i realy dont like to pay. Additionally the 7/11 make it not easier where you can always buy some snacks.

So to summe everything up the BudgetBuddy App is realy a pain point killer for me and i would pay sure 1$ for it.
